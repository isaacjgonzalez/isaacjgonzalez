👋 Hi, this is Isaac González

⛓️ Blockchain researcher and consultant.

✏️ I have a mix of IT (CS engineer), entepreneurship (MBA) and crypto background (DeFi PhD). 

🌱 I have worked as CS enginner for several years, then I create my own company ([cilenis.com](https://cilenis.com)) which developed several NLP tools ([linguakit.com](https://linguakit.com)). After that, I felt in love with blockchain which I have been studied since 2017 while teaching IT. In 2022 I started as researcher and consultant in [Crypto Oxygen](https://crypto-oxygen.com).

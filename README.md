👋 Hi, this is Isaac González

⛓️ Blockchain researcher and consultant.

✏️ I have a mix of IT (CS engineer & dev experience), entrepreneurship (MBA & startup CEO), and crypto background (DeFi PhD & crypto consultant). 

🌱 I have worked as a CS engineer for several years, then I created my own company ([cilenis.com](https://cilenis.com)), which developed several NLP tools ([linguakit.com](https://linguakit.com)). After that, I fell in love with blockchain, which I have been studying since 2017 while teaching IT. In 2022, I started as a researcher and consultant at [Crypto Oxygen](https://crypto-oxygen.com). Actually, I am developing projects and offering consultancy at [Folerpa](https://folerpa.com).
